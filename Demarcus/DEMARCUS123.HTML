  <ul>
<li> Preheat oven to 450 degrees <span> <i>( pound chicken breast should be light and thick)</i> </span> </li>
<li> Pour olive oil in a 13" x 9" baking dish. Lightly coat the chicken with the oil to coat it, then place chicken breasts side by side in the dish. </li>
<li> In a small bowl, whisk together salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and chili powder (or paprika). Sprinkle the seasoning mixture over both sides of the chicken and rub it in with your hands. Place chicken breasts side by side, making sure there is no overlap. </li>
<li>Bake in a preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, until juices are clear or a meat thermometer reads 160-170 degrees. *Note - depending on the size of your chicken breasts, it could take longer. Mine were pounded to less than an inch thick. </li>
<li>Cover with foil and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes while the juices settle before slicing. </li>
<li> <h1> MAKE SURE YOU SERVE HOT </h1> </li>
